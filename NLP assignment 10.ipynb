CNNs use convolutional layers that apply filters across local receptive fields to detect various visual patterns, such as edges, textures, or shapes. These learned features are hierarchical, where lower layers capture low-level features, and higher layers capture more complex, abstract features. The extracted features are then passed through fully connected layers for classification or other tasks.\n",

Techniques for addressing this issue include data augmentation of minority classes, resampling techniques such as oversampling or undersampling, using specialized loss functions like focal loss or weighted loss functions, or employing ensemble methods that balance class distributions. Another approach is to perform class-aware sampling during mini-batch creation to ensure equal representation of different classes. These techniques help mitigate the impact of class imbalance and improve the model's ability to learn from underrepresented classes.\n",

    "48. Transfer learning in CNNs involves leveraging knowledge gained from pre-trained models on a large dataset and applying it to a different but related task. By starting with a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on a smaller task-specific dataset, transfer learning helps improve performance and generalization, especially when the target dataset is limited. It allows the model to transfer learned features and representations, capturing common visual patterns, and reducing the need for extensive training data. Transfer learning is particularly beneficial when the pre-trained model is trained on a similar domain or task.\n",

    "49. CNN models can handle data with missing or incomplete information by using techniques such as zero-padding or masking. Zero-padding involves filling missing or incomplete regions with zeros, allowing the model to process the data while ignoring the padded regions. Masking involves assigning a binary mask to indicate the presence or absence of information, where the model learns to attend only to the available data. These techniques ensure that the CNN can process and learn from data with missing or incomplete information without compromising the overall performance.\n",

    "50. Multi-label classification in CNNs involves assigning multiple labels to an input sample, where each label is not mutually exclusive. Techniques for solving this task include modifying the loss function to handle multiple labels, using activation functions like sigmoid in the output layer to predict the probability of each label independently, and thresholding the probabilities to determine the presence or absence of each label. Evaluation metrics for multi-label classification include precision, recall, F1-score, or mean average precision (mAP), which consider both the presence and absence of multiple labels."
