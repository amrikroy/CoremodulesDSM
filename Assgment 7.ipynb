    "To monitor the performance of deployed machine learning models and detect anomalies, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define performance metrics: Establish a set of performance metrics that align with the goals and requirements of your machine learning model. These metrics may include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or custom business-specific metrics. Define thresholds or acceptable ranges for each metric to identify deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up monitoring infrastructure: Implement a monitoring system that collects relevant data and metrics from the deployed model and its surrounding environment. This can include logging frameworks, monitoring tools, or custom scripts that capture data related to model inputs, outputs, latency, resource usage, and system health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance in real-time to detect anomalies promptly. Monitor prediction outputs, compare them against expected values or ground truth labels, and track the distribution of inputs and outputs. Implement alerting mechanisms to trigger notifications when anomalies or deviations from normal behavior are detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drift detection: Monitor data drift to identify when the distribution of incoming data significantly deviates from the training data. This can be done by comparing statistical measures or feature distributions of new data with the data used during model training. Sudden or gradual drift can indicate changes in the underlying patterns or context, requiring model retraining or updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance degradation detection: Monitor performance metrics over time to identify any degradation. Set up automated processes to analyze and compare metric trends and detect when performance falls below acceptable thresholds. Sudden drops, significant variations, or consistent deterioration can indicate issues with the model's performance."
